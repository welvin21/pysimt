Data preparation
--

Run `prepare.sh` (or `prepare_osx.sh` specifically if you are under MacOS) from this folder to create word-level tokenized corpora and
related vocabulary files. The script will also download and unpack the
object classification (OC) and object detection (OD) features under `features/`.
